# Build Error Fix - Payment Pages

## Issue

Next.js build was failing with:

```
Export encountered an error on /payment/failure/page
Next.js build worker exited with code: 1
```

## Root Cause

The payment pages (`success`, `failure`, `cancel`) were using `useSearchParams()` hook without wrapping in a Suspense boundary. Next.js 15+ requires Suspense boundaries for dynamic hooks like `useSearchParams()` during static generation/export.

## Solution Applied

### Files Modified:

1. `src/app/payment/success/page.tsx`
2. `src/app/payment/failure/page.tsx`
3. `src/app/payment/cancel/page.tsx`

### Changes Made:

-   Wrapped the component content in a separate function (e.g., `PaymentSuccessContent`)
-   Exported a default component that wraps the content with `<Suspense>`
-   Added loading fallback UI for each page

### Example Pattern:

```tsx
"use client";
import { Suspense } from "react";
import { useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";

function PaymentFailureContent() {
    const searchParams = useSearchParams();
    // ... component logic
}

export default function PaymentFailurePage() {
    return (
        <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
            <PaymentFailureContent />
        </Suspense>
    );
}
```

## Result

✅ Build completes successfully
✅ All payment pages compile without errors
✅ Static generation works correctly

## Testing

Build verified with:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Output:

```
✓ Compiled successfully in 22.5s
✓ Generating static pages (32/32)
```
